#In this assignment, you will create a simulation of the university cafeteria where customers arrive, 
#purchase items, and leave. The program should track the inventory of the items, simulate customer 
#transactions, and generate a report of the day's sales.

import random 

print("The canteen is now open for today")

#Task 1: items: List of product names, prices: List of product prices, inventories: List of product inventories.
items = ["Sandwich", "Salad", "Cake", "Bun", "Coffee", "Iced Coffee", "Water", "Soda"]

#Task 2: Simulate customers

#Task 3: process sales and total revenue

        index = items.index(sale) #find the position of the item in the list
        total_revenue += prices[index] #add its price to the total 
    return total_revenue

# Task 4: Generate sales report
def generate_report(sales): #defines a function for the sales report
    print("\n DAILY SALES REPORT ")
    total_revenue = process_sales(sales)  # calculates the total revenue
 
  #prints how many of each item was sold and reaming stock
    for i in range(len(items)): #go through all items
        sold_count = sales.count(items[i]) #count how many times the item was sold
        print(f"{items[i]}: sold {sold_count}, remaining stock: {inventories[i]}")

# Run the simulation
sales_today = simulate_customers(10) #ssimulates 10 customers visiting the cafeteriaa 
generate_report(sales_today) #generates the daily sales report

# Task 5: Calculate the cost of leftover items
def leftover_inventory():

        leftover = inventories[i]              # how many are left
        cost_per_item = prices[i] / 2          # production cost is half the price
        total_cost += leftover * cost_per_item # add cost for this item
